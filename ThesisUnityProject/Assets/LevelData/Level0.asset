  showGoalTime: 2
  goalExplanation: 'Now comes your mission: Go through that area with a <b>constant
    velocity</b>. Good Luck!'
  startDetectTime: 3
  errorHints:
  - It has to be a <b>constant velocity</b>!
  - 'So the box should move with a steady speed in a straight line. '
  - Forces change the box's moving direction or speed, did you see that?
  - In a word, remove the forces before your box enters the area.
  whenSuccess: YAYYY, good job!
