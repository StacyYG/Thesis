  errorHints:
  - The gate can only be passed through with a <b>constant velocity</b>.
  - 'So the box should move with a steady speed in a straight line. '
  - Force changes the box's moving direction or speed, right?
  - So remove the forces before your box enters the area.
  whenSuccess: Good job.
